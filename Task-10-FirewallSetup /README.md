# Mini Project: Firewall Configuration with UFW

## Objective  
To configure and manage a basic firewall on a Linux system using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**.  
The goal is to secure the system by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic while allowing essential services.

---

## Tools Used  
- **Linux**  
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**  
- **Terminal access** with `sudo` 

---

## Conclusion  
The firewall was successfully configured to:  
- Block all unwanted **incoming traffic**  
- Allow **outgoing traffic**  
- Permit only **essential services** (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)  
- Block access from **suspicious IPs**  

This ensures **basic system hardening** and strengthens **network security**.
