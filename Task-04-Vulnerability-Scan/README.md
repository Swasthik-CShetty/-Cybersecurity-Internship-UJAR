# Task 4: Basic Vulnerability Scan (Cybersecurity Internship ‚Äì Phase 1)

## üéØ Objective
Perform a vulnerability scan on a local test web application (OWASP Juice Shop) using OWASP ZAP to identify common security misconfigurations and weaknesses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **OWASP ZAP 2.16.1**
- **OWASP Juice Shop** (Docker/local)
- **Browser** (Chrome with proxy set to `127.0.0.1:8080`)

## üîç Steps Performed
1. Installed and configured OWASP ZAP.
2. Set browser proxy to route traffic through ZAP.
3. Accessed Juice Shop web application to generate traffic.
4. Ran the Automated Scan in ZAP.
5. Exported the vulnerability report (`Vulnerability_Report.html`).
6. Reviewed the top issues and researched solutions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Issues Found
1. **Cookie Security Weaknesses**
   - Cookies missing `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` flags.
   - Risk: Session hijacking, CSRF.
   - **Fix:** Add `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax/Strict`.

2. **Missing Security Headers**
   - No `Strict-Transport-Security` and `X-Content-Type-Options`.
   - Risk: MITM attacks, MIME sniffing.
   - **Fix:** Configure server to send:
     ```http
     Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
     X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
     ```
