Project: Basic Network Packet Sniffer
1. Introduction

Network sniffing is the process of capturing and analyzing packets transmitted over a network. This project implements a Python-based packet sniffer to monitor live traffic, filter by protocol (e.g., HTTP/FTP), and extract key information like IP addresses, ports, and payloads. This helps in understanding network behavior and potential security issues.

2. Abstract

The sniffer captures network packets using Scapy, analyzes headers to extract relevant information, and logs the data for review. This project demonstrates practical networking and cybersecurity concepts, such as packet inspection and protocol analysis. Capturing live traffic provides insights into active network sessions, potential vulnerabilities, and unusual activity.

3. Tools Used

Operating System: Kali Linux 

Programming Language: Python 3

Library: Scapy (for capturing and analyzing packets)
